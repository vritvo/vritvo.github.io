At heart, I’m someone who asks a lot of questions and loves following ideas wherever they lead. I’m happiest when I’m learning something new, building something that didn’t exist before, or trying to understand why we think or feel about things the way we do.

I did my PhD in **Neuroscience and Psychology** at **[Princeton University](https://compmem.princeton.edu/)**, where I studied memory and learning. My research combined **behavioral experiments**, **fMRI studies**, and **biologically-plausible neural network models** to understand how people update their memories over time.

After graduate school, I joined the **[Data Science for Social Good Fellowship](https://dssgfellowship.org/)** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, where I worked on a small team collaborating with local governments in Douglas and Johnson Counties, Kansas. We combined data from numerous county agencies to build a **machine learning pipeline** that identified individuals at risk of **behavioral-health** crises (e.g., suicide or overdose).

I later worked as a **data scientist/data insights engineer** at **[Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/)**, which rethinks how oncology data can be used to improve patient outcomes. My work there focused on building data pipelines, reshaping business tools, and navigating the challenges of large-scale medical datasets.

I’m currently at the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed retreat for programmers. It’s been a chance to learn a wide range of new technical and **AI engineering** skills, including how to build **semantic search** tasks and **multi-agent systems**. I've been able to do all of that while making projects about my niche interests and obsessions—like a *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* semantic-search engine, a performance-art-ish academic “conference” simulation populated by AI grad students, and an app to find beautiful Stonehenge-like moments anywhere in the world.

I also write—criticism, essays, and poetry—usually about the stories we tell ourselves and why they matter. [Here's](https://slate.com/culture/2023/01/last-of-us-hbo-episode-3-nick-offerman.html) an example of my writing.
