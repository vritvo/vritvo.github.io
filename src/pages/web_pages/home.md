### Hello! Welcome to my site. 

### I’m deeply curious about how humans construct meaning — how we remember, how we make sense of information, and how we interpret the world around us. 

### I use whatever tools are the best for understanding that, from data and AI to psychology and writing.

I was a cognitive psychology / neuroscience researcher, and then moved into tech-for-good machine learning and data science. I'm now at the Recurse Center, building software and AI tools that let me combine technical work with the creative pursuits I love.
