#### Hello! I'm a data scientist with a background in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, and I build software to explore and understand complex systems. 

I've worked across research and industry on problems involving data, human behavior, and interpretation — from machine learning systems in healthcare and public-interest settings to exploratory and creative software projects.

A common thread across my work is understanding how people make sense of complex information, and building tools and systems that help turn that understanding into decisions.
