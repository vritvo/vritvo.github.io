#### Hello! I'm a data scientist with a background in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, and I build software to explore and interpret complex systems. 

I've worked in both research and industry, on problems involving data, human cognition, and interpretation — from machine learning systems to more exploratory and creative software projects. A lot of that work has been in applied settings, including healthcare tech and public-interest work. 

A common thread across it all is an interest in how humans construct meaning: how we remember, how we interpret information, and how data shapes understanding.
